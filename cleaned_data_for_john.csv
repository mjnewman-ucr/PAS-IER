8011,"My anger stemmed from a domino effect of events. During the summer heading into my first quarter of college, my parents forced me to go on a trip to Las Vegas with them and, even though I was grateful for a trip not everyone gets to experience, I wasn't happy throughout the trip, because I had nothing to do. When I got back, my aunt invited me to go to the beach, but the Vegas trip tired me out and I wanted to do something I actually wanted to do. Unfortunately, my parents and aunt ridiculed me for not going, saying I was lazy. Then at night, when I wanted to eat at home, considering we at out everyday as Vegas, my parents again forced me to go with them. When we got back home, I was finally able to do something I enjoyed, video games. However, before I could even play for 30 minutes, my mom started yelling at me to go to bed and threatened to throw away my xbox, something I payed for myself. At that point I was extremely angry of having absolutely no control over my life. I was frustrated at never having a say in anything and never getting options. I was angry at constantly pushing aside my happiness and being ridiculed for just taking time to enjoy the things I liked.","I was angry and sad at the same time. I was made of all the things that happened, but also sad that my parents didn't consider how I was feeling at the time. I didn't want to interact with anyone the next few days and locked myself in my room. I was tired of living a life my parents wanted, not the one I wanted.","My dad finally sat me and my mom down and we all had a discussion about why I was so angry. I told them about why those events made me feel like my life was being controlled, even though I was 18 years old already. My dad said he understood how all the events that happened could've made me feel restricted from simply living my own life. My mom didn't see it that way, but thats the difference between them. My dad sees and treats me like a man or an adult, while my mom still sees me as her little boy and thus treats me like one. My mom told me I was acting out and being disobedient. However, my whole childhood, I've foregone birthday parties with friends, events, basketball games, vacations to do things my parents wanted. I never enjoyed school, but I went to the library to study for my parents. My dad understood this, but also told me that isolating myself wouldn't fix any problems. So he made a deal with me. I would get to dictate my own life more, now that I was older. This meant a giving me a choice on whether I wanted to participate. This also meant not isolating myself any longer and communicating my anger sooner in the future and not letting it build up. My mom on the other hand, was now angry at me and my dad. She went on her phone and told my aunts how rude I was to want some independence in my life as an adult. I still live under her roof so I still abide by her rules, but having to live a life thats only in the realm of want my parents condemned seemed unfair to me.",2,NA,mother,1,2,8,7,7,8,7,7,6,8,7,6,6,8,6,6,7,7,7,6,8,1,3,7,5,2,3,5,6,7,6,5,5,6,5,6,3,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,2,4,2,3,3,3,3,4,3,5,1,3,5,5,4,3,4,4,3,4,5,2,3,2,2,2,4,2,3,3,3,2,5,2,5,4,4,2,3,3,5,6,4,5,2,4,5,4,3,4,2,3,2,5,2,3,5,2,2,1,2,3,2,4,3,3,3,4,3,2,3,4,1,4,2,4,3,4,5,4,2,4,3,5,4,1,3,3,2,2,3,5,2,2,4,2,3,3,5,3,3,2,1,29,104,1,NA,1,NA,1,1,1,NA,12,NA,1,2,8,73,36,50,12,17,18,14,8,12,16
